# Song Draw

Song Draw is a progressive web app that randomly "draws" songs to play from the arcade game DanceDanceRevolution.

This app is inspired by DDRCardDraw but without a focus on tournament features such as "banning" and "pocket picking".

**IMPORTANT**: This PWA is not fully supported on iOS Safari and desktop screens at the moment!

## Development

1. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.
3. Navigate to `localhost:1234`.
